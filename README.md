This is mostly a prototype that I plan to possible use for my future projects.

Controls:

WASD - Movement
Mouse - Aim
Left mouse button - Shoot
ESC - Go to menu

I - Inventory

In the inventory:

G - Generate weapon
N - Clear inventory
, - Decrease player level
. - increase player level
Left mouse button - Equip selected weapon
ESC or I - exit inventory

Config:

Inside the config folder is the config.ini file
Here you can change a few things about the prototype, although it can easily break it.

For an FPS increase to matter, the ticksPerSecond have to be also increased to at least the same amount.
