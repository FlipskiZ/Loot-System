This is mostly a prototype that I plan to probably use for other projects in the future.

Controls:

WASD - Movement
E - Use
Mouse - Aim
Left mouse button - Shoot
ESC - Go to the menu
I - Inventory

In the inventory:

N - Clear inventory
Left Shift - Compare item to currently equipped item
Left mouse button - Equip selected weapon
Right mouse button - delete selected weapon
ESC or I - exit inventory

Gameplay:

Enemies attack you if they get too close, first they will try to scratch you and then they will try to bite you if they are close enough.

If you move to the side of the map, you will move to a new segment of the world map. With new enemies and weapons.

Every world segment there is a chest randomly spawned on the map, with the exception of the first chest which will always be in the same position.

The farther away from the starting map you are, the higher the level of enemies and weapons become.

The level range is in between 1-100.

Config:
Inside the config folder is the config.ini file.
Here you can change a few things about the prototype, although some things can easily break it.
